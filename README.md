# SpotifyTimeMachine

This project utilizes Beautiful Soup to parse the Billboard Top 100 songs list for a user-specified date. The script then employs the Spotipy package to authenticate with Spotify, search for the songs, and retrieve their URIs. It includes error handling for unavailable songs. Finally, the script creates a Spotify playlist named after the user-provided date, containing all the available songs.
